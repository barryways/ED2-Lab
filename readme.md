## Backend

The project uses express to provide all the data to the frontend by a REST API, this helps to comunicate the project with new technologies. Using express has another reasons, like using a new language for the code courses in the university

## Frontend

The project uses React to have a good relationship with the backend and use async functions for receive all the data, the frontend was though for looks good and easy to modify.
